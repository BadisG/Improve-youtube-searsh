# Improve-youtube-searsh
Automatically adds "after:2004" after pressing ENTER on the searsh bar

# Context

The YouTube search function has become quite inefficient these days. It tends to suggest irrelevant things like:
- “People also watched”
- “New channels for you”
- “For you”

To fix this, we can simply add to our searsh input: 'after:2004'

The limitation of this approach is the necessity to rewrite this each time.   
**This Chrome extension will conveniently rewrite 'after:2004' after you pressed Enter**
